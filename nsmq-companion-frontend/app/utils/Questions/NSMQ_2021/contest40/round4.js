Thomson.\nWe both deal with beams.\nWhile J.J. was interested in the negatively charged beam, I was interested in the positively charged beam.\nIn my operations positively charged units are first transformed into a beam.\nThe beam is made to travel through a magnetic field which separates the components according to mass-to-charge ratios.\nWho am I?",
